/**
 * Fired by {@code /fd cleanup} after FarmersDelight has cleaned its own orphan display / tray entities, so
 * addons can clean their own state in the same admin pass. Listeners report how many entities they removed
 * via {@link #addRemoved(int)}; the command sums those counts into its final reply.
 *
 * <p>Mirrors {@link FarmersDelightReloadEvent} as the cleanup-side hook for addons. Listeners should treat
 * this as a one-shot admin signal (not periodic) and may do best-effort regional scheduling on Folia — the
 * count is allowed to be "scheduled for removal" rather than "removed before this method returns".
