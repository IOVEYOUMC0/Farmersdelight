/**
 * Keeps reloads serialised and spaces them out, mirroring how CraftEngine guards its own reload
 * ({@code ResourceOperationCoordinator}: one operation at a time, a second request is refused rather than
 * queued).
 *
 * <p>A full reload is not free: FarmersDelight's own pass is roughly 200 ms of server-thread work, its addons
 * rebuild on the following tick for roughly another 140 ms, and both land on the tick thread. Queueing a
 * second request would therefore stack two stalls back to back, so the later one is refused outright. The
 * cooldown covers the addon cascade, which runs after the command has already returned.
